# AdobeAnalyticsChallenge
Adobe Analytics Challenge is the only global business competition where college students solve challenges using real, anonymized data from leading brands. During the Analytics Challenge, teams are tasked with uncovering insights using Adobe Analytics to provide recommendations addressing a pressing business challenge. 

## Project Description
In our project, we will identify differences between business and leisure travelers, while keeping an eye on the emergence of “bleisure”—a growing trend where consumers add extra days to their business trips to relax and explore the cities they’re visiting. We will use anonymized, digital experience data provided by Hilton to recommend personalization strategies across different touchpoints, including its website and mobile app, looking at how Hilton can innovate to customize content and experiences for different types of guests and travel needs. Since the information provided by Hilton is anonymized, no personal information will be shared with Adobe or the students as part of the competition.

## Main Analysis

  - #### H-ospitality
  - #### I-tegrity
  - #### L-eadership
  - #### T-eamwork
  - #### O-wnership

### 1. Success Metrics
  - Primary Metrics: Digital Reservation:
    Since cashflow is the most important objective for any businesses, especially after Covid-19, we decided to use it as a measure of profitability and conversion rate for Hilton
  - Secondary Metrics: People, Session, Event:
    This metric measures the long-term relationship between business and customers so it will help us identify the differences in digital usages across different types of customers 
  - Additional Metrics: Time Spent per Session:
    This metrics helps give insights into the underlying decision-making process of different types of customers towards a successful coversion.
